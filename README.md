# Symptom-organization

Nonmentric_MDS_code_Fleming.r is the code for implementing MDS, the permutation of the data for testing robustness of MDS, running the cluster analysis and to test for congruence between MDS results for different datasets.

Exclusion_Criteria_for_MDS.r is the code for exclusion criteria used to remove symptom scale items which had low endorsement or low communality and were thus not included when running the MDS.
